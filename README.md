# fish-tmpdir

[Fish](http://fishshell.com/) function that creates a temporary directory, `cd`s into it, and wipes it out when the shell exits.

Based on the [Bash version](https://github.com/mafintosh/tmpdir-tab) by @mafintosh.

## CLI

`tmpdir` brings you to a fresh directory.

`tmpdir [-s | --spawn]` opens a subshell instead of utilizing the current one.

## Install

Put the script to your `~/.config/fish/functions/` or source it elsewise.
